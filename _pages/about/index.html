<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Welcome.! I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/mbr/people-1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Research Lab</a> headed by Dr. Mark Driscoll in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at McGill. My work mainly focuses on the Biomechanics of Human Spine and it’s modeling. As the name suggests, my lab works in various fields ranging from FE Simulations to Benchtop model design to Virtual surgery planning - all revolving around the human spine, it’s stability and various medical conditions related to it.</p> <p>My research interests include Robot design, Control, Experimental validation. My PhD work is focused on developing a validated robotic benchtop spinal model for use as a research tool in low back research. I also do some <a href="/picxel">web dev</a> and delve in cybersecurity topics.</p> <p>I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="https://manipal.edu/mu.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Manipal University</a>, India and did my bachelor’s thesis with the <a href="http://mech.vub.ac.be/multibody_mechanics.htm" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">R&amp;MM Research Group</a> at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium.</p> <p>I was also a part of <a href="https://southasia.marssociety.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mars Society South Asia</a> and worked on promoting space exploration and education in the 7 South Asian countries by organizing robotic competitions like <a href="https://southasia.marssociety.org/indianroverchallenge/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IRC</a>, <a href="https://southasia.marssociety.org/irdc/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IRDC</a> etc.</p> <p>In my free time, I enjoy doing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/siril.td/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">photography</a>. I love <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/82563036" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cycling</a> and go on long biking trips during summers.</p> </body></html>
