Welcome! I am a PhD graduate in Mechanical Engineering from McGill University, where I worked at the [Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Research Lab](https://www.mcgill.ca/mbr/people-1) under the supervision of Dr. Mark Driscoll.  

My research focused on the biomechanics of the human spine and its modeling, combining computational simulations, benchtop model development, and translational applications. Specifically, my doctoral work centered on developing and validating a robotic benchtop spinal model to advance research in low back pain and spinal stability.  

My broader research interests span musculoskeletal modeling, robotics and control, and experimental validation. I also explore topics in digital health, medical device development, and occasionally enjoy working on [web development](/picxel) and cybersecurity.  

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Manipal University](https://manipal.edu/mu.html), India, and completed my bachelorâ€™s thesis with the [R&MM Research Group](https://www.brubotics.eu/research/self-healing-research) at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium.  

Previously, I was part of the [Mars Society South Asia](https://southasia.marssociety.org/), promoting space exploration and education in the region by organizing robotics competitions such as [IRC](https://southasia.marssociety.org/indianroverchallenge/) and [IRDC](https://southasia.marssociety.org/irdc/).  

In my free time, I enjoy [photography](https://www.instagram.com/siril.td/), [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/82563036), and going on long-distance biking trips during the summer.
